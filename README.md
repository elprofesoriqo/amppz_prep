# 🧠 Competitive Programming – Training Tasks

This repository contains tasks solved as part of our preparations for the Polish Academic Championships in Team Programming (AMPPZ) and other algorithmic competitions.  
Collaborative effort by: Igor, Zachariasz, Antek.

## 📁 Directory Structure

- `codeforces/` – tasks from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- `szkopul/` – tasks from [Szkopul.edu.pl](https://szkopul.edu.pl/)
- `usaco/` – tasks from [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/)
- `algorithms/` – our own implementations of common algorithms (DFS, Dijkstra, Segment Tree, etc.)
- `meetit/` – problems from the Polish Olympiad in Informatics [meetit](https://platform.meetit.pl/)

## 👥 Collaboration Guidelines

To add a task:
1. Create a folder using the task's ID.
   - Inside it, create:
     - a folder for input/output files (`.in`, `.out`)
     - a folder for your own solution(s)
2. Commit your changes with clear and descriptive messages, e.g.,  
   `Added Codeforces 1234A solution`.

## 🔧 Tools

- Compile C++:  
  `g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -Wall task.cpp -o task`
- Test locally:  
  `./task < input.in > output.out && diff output.out expected.out`

For personal/team use only – do not copy tasks 1:1 into contests. 👀
